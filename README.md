# Gravel Pit Color Theme

![gravel-pit example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeatScherrer/gravel-pit/master/gravel_pit_example.png)

Welcome to my color theme. Since I was unhappy with many color themes for C++ I decided to create my own and publish it.
The theme is oriented on earthy colors which are light to the eye for the basic entities. highly interesting entities such as objects, variables, methods and function are given a brighter color to immediately differentiate them.
The colors range from anything that can be found in a pit from dirt to water and even gemstones, and thus the name.

_The theme is still under heavy development and thus will change often._

## C++
The main items which I want to differentiate for C++ explicitly from the rest are the following:
* **Functions** and **methods**:
It should be clear on first sight what is a function, a method and visually separate them from the rest.

A very useful extension for better C++ Syntax highlighting is provided by the following extension:

# Contribution
Contribution for other languages are very welcome to create a consistent and complete theme across various languages.

# TODO
